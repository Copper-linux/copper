       because the commands were never missing.

       PID 1 starts with an environment the kernel builds, and it has no PATH
       in it. When a program has no PATH, execvp() falls back to
       confstr(_CS_PATH), which is the kernel's compiled-in default:

           /bin:/usr/bin

       Copper's networking applets are in sbin. So `ip`, `ifconfig`, `route`,
       `arp` and everything else installed under /sbin and /usr/sbin were
       unreachable by name, while `ping`, `grep`, `touch` and the rest worked
       because they are in /bin and /usr/bin. The commands were present,
       compiled in, and correctly linked the whole time -- the shell was
       simply never told to look in sbin.

       Setting it in start_dhcp() did not help, because that runs in a forked
